# Nexai

Nexai is the first fully decentralized, autonomous, and integratable chatbot and assistant that runs on blockchain and artificial intelligence. The main goal of Nexai is to provide a personalized user experience and assist with various tasks on different platforms, from e-commerce to social media.

## Stage

At present, Nexai has made substantial progress, reaching a significant milestone resembling an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). We are actively engaged in rigorous testing and refinement of the platform.

<!--We are constantly seeking new contributors who are interested in joining our project and helping us bring our vision to life.-->

We welcome any feedback, suggestions, or questions about Nexai and are excited to continue working on this innovative project.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with nexai, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd nexai/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
